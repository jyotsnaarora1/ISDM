Brainstorm 

- Match end-customers with well informed RMs with appropriate knowledge about the destination and its tradition. 

- Create a questionnaire for the initial phase of RM profiles, the questionnaire will assist and work in collaboration with the matcher tool, to effectively match the RM with the customer. This means that there must be a singular questionnaire to Build RM profile based on the criteria in the questions. 

- System adjusts RM profiles constantly based on RMs performance in selling. The system will adapt and change when the RM is upskilled and constantly reaching KPIs.

- A database will store a target list for outbound calls, each customer is in the form of <potential customer, product proposed> 

- The target list will use the skill matcher to match the appropriate RM. Potentially have a target list go into a ‘RMs target list’ file for each individual RM. This collated target list will be provided to the RM everyday with new a new list

- Create a preloaded criteria for inbound customers. There must be a certain number of questions or criteria that the system will present to the customer to answer using their keypad to assist in routing the call.

- Calculate skill score based on RM’s previous call duration and profile. 

- Customers with high scores get more priority

- RMs can alternate between inbound and outbound calls by selecting whether they want to receive calls or make calls. The system will generate the target list automatically to make calls once outbound calls are selected

- RMs can put themselves on ‘NOT ready’  option to stop the inflow of calls if they need to follow up with their existing customers who they have dealt with before. 

- When customers are routed to an unsuitable RM they are able to transfer directly to the suitable RM so the customer doesn't have to wait in the queue again. RM will know they are unsuitable due to the customer profile.

- RMs are able to put their customers on hold to investigate complex situations further, the system will play music when ‘hold status’ is active. RMs can also put themselves on MUTE if they need to do quick investigating.

- Customers can choose their language before the call is routed to ensure optimum selectability and routing to RMS
