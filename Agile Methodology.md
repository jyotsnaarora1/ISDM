The scrum methodology is the most suitable and appropriate methodology to be utilised in this project. Since the development of this plan is somewhat complicated and unpredictable, despite their being instructions there isnâ€™t a fully defined process to how the project should be done as many changes can be made, or some requirements are not understood yet. Our team decided that there will be required deliverables; a backlog to be completed in increments. These increments will be developed or curated in the form of sprints with a specific time to have them completed by. When a deliverable is completed such as diagrams section in the assignment the sprint is then reviewed and look for ways we can improve.

The team will use GitHub, to submit work in iterations based on the backlog which includes the necessary deliverables to be submitted into the final report. Github allows the team to have version control and records all changes made that we can revert back to, compare changes over and see who has modified the files.  Through collaborating on Github were able to edit each others work and create more backlog deliverables for the next sprint.
