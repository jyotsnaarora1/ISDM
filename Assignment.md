1.	Problem Definition & objectives

Problem Definition
A major travel company performs sales of various holiday packages over calls in their call management centre (CMC). Relationship Managers (RM) are expected to provide information to customers about the variety and nature of the holidays packages they offer encouraging them to purchase it.
