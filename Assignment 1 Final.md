# Travel Company Call Management Centre

## Problem Definition
A major travel company performs sales of various holiday packages over calls in their call management centre (CMC). Relationship Managers (RM) are expected to provide information to customers about the variety and nature of the holidays packages they offer encouraging them to purchase it.

Currently, the inbound customers are connected to the fist available Relationship Manager (RM) at the CMC. This sometimes can cause issues as some of the new RM’s may not have enough information about the holiday package and can discourage the customer from purchasing a holiday package. During busy time, customers may be directed to an Interactive Voice Response resulting in low customer engagement and loss of opportunities. Customers can also hang up if they suffer from a long wait time in the queue.

RMs are looking to improve the call routing system and the call flow rate for both inbound and outbound calls to improve their service to their end and potential customers. 

## Objectives
The objectives of the project is to:

+ Provide efficient call routing and dynamic call flow control allowing RMs to serve their end and potential customers.
+ Reduce wait times for inbound customers.
+ Improve customer experience by matching RMs that have the product knowledge required by the customers.
+ Improve the customer experience for repeat customers to encourage more purchases.

## Competitive Advantage
Having a competitive advantage puts a firm in a favourable position over other businesses in the market. The travel company with an effective call management centre system will ensure that the company is reducing costs and able to carry out effective conversations to potentially convert every call into revenue. Companies are able to use their business systems to leverage the company against competitors as it can have positive effects on business functions.

**Reducing Costs**

Reducing costs is crucial for any company. Reducing costs while still maintaining an appropriate operational performance is advantageous in a competitive market. When calls are managed through the CMC, the end customers and relationship managers are matched appropriately. This will allow for less wastage time, more sales and reducing operational costs such as time spent on phone without sales and phone bills. Another form of costs may be the excess of travel agency stores. With the adoption of an efficient CMC, companies are able to cut commercial rent costs, employees and other costs working in brick and mortar stores. A CMC will digitise the customer experience and further be able to increase the traffic as time spent with customers is reduced. For example, an RM in a call centre using a CMC will have more foot traffic than an employee in a traditional brick and mortar store resulting in greater traffic and increased conversions hence cutting costs whilst increasing profits for the firm.

**Customer loyalty and intimacy**

Furthermore, the CMC will be able to match the customers wants and needs with the profile of the RM. Customers who are understood and being approached in a relatable matter are more likely to purchase products or in this case travel packages. The CMC will help the RMs learn about the customer upon opening an account or through the specified target list. Having RMs know crucial details about customers aid in engaging in conversation, building rapport, insights to wants, needs and pain points. After this, RMs are able to use empathy and critical problem-solving skills to convert the conversation into a sale. For example, a customer is calling in to find packages for flights and accommodations for Dubai and can only speak Arabic, the RM matched will be bilingual in Arabic and have proficient knowledge on Dubai. The overarching idea here is that a CMC can help gain insights on customers and match RMs based on similar criteria. This will boost customer experience and satisfaction, resulting in increased customer loyalty and intimacy, in turn putting the firm in a leading position. 

**Productivity and Efficiency**

Essentially, the overarching goal of the new system will be to improve and maintain productivity and efficiency. The system route calls by skill, therefore, allows customers to be on the phone for a shorter period of time and overall gives the customer a more effective experience. When an agent is able to secure a sale at minimum touchpoints, the agent is being more efficient and productive than just simply routing the calls to correct people or searching for information to give the customer. The system can make outbound calls using the target list which routes call to the appropriate customer, this results in reduced idle times where the agent is not merely waiting for a call to come through, therefore the agent is more productive. By implementing these features into the system the company is leveraging its operations to remain and sustain a competitive advantage.

## Agile Methodology - Scrum
The scrum methodology is the most suitable and appropriate methodology to be utilised in this project. Since the development of this plan is somewhat complicated and unpredictable, despite there being instructions there isn’t a fully defined process to how the project should be done as many changes can be made, or some requirements are not understood yet. Our team decided that there will be required deliverables; a backlog to be completed in increments. These increments will be developed or curated in the form of sprints with a specific time to have them completed by. When a deliverable is completed, such as diagrams section in the assignment, the sprint is then reviewed and the team then looks for ways we can improve.

The team will use GitHub to submit work in iterations based on the backlog which includes the necessary deliverables to be submitted into the final report. Github allows the team to have version control and records all changes made that we can revert back to, compare changes over and see who has modified the files. Through collaborating on GitHub, we were able to edit each others work and create more backlog deliverables for the next sprint.
