# ISDM Assignment
## Travel Company Call Management Centre

## Problem Definition
A major travel company performs sales of various holiday packages over calls in their call management centre (CMC). Relationship Managers (RM) are expected to provide information to customers about the variety and nature of the holidays packages they offer encouraging them to purchase it.

Currently, the inbound customers are connected to the fist available Relationship Manager (RM) or employee at the CMC. This sometimes can cause issues as some of the new RM’s may not have enough information about the holiday package and can discourage the customer from purchasing a holiday package. During busy time, customers may be directed to an Interactive Voice Response resulting in low customer engagement and loss of opportunities. Customers can also hang up if they suffer from a long wait time in the queue.

RM’s are looking to improve the call routing system and the call flow rate for both inbound and outbound calls to improve their service to their end and potential customers.
